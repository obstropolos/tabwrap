# TabWrap

**Version 0.1**

TabWrap version 0.1 is a basic chrome extension leveraging the tabs, windows, 
and storage API from Google Chrome in order to allow the user to save groups
of tabs and redeploy them later (for any productive purpose). The initial
version features three slots, allows the user to update the title of a slot,
and provides an information button to check what tabs are in each slot. 

**To Deploy**

Simply download the repository, enable developer mode on [chrome://extensions](url),
"Load unpacked" and select the folder.
